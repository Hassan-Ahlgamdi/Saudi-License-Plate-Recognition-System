A robust, multi-stage AI pipeline designed to detect and recognize Saudi Arabian license plates with high precision. This project moves beyond traditional OCR methods, utilizing a **Cascade Object Detection** strategy to handle complex backgrounds, bilingual text, and varying lighting conditions.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Cascade Architecture:** Uses two specialized YOLO models—one to find the plate and one to detect individual characters.
* **Logic-Based Filtering:** Custom geometric algorithms filter out the "KSA" emblem and Arabic script based on vertical positioning, isolating the ID number.
* **Bilingual Output:** Automatically maps detected English characters to their official Arabic counterparts (e.g., `S` → `س`).

## 🏗️ Architecture Pipeline

The system processes images in four distinct stages:

1.  **Plate Detection:** A custom YOLOv11 model (trained on ~4,500 images) locates the license plate ROI.
2.  **Preprocessing:** The ROI is cropped using model coordinates.
3.  **Character Detection:** A secondary YOLOv11-Nano model (trained on ~1,300 annotated plates) detects letters and numbers (`0-9`, `A-Z`) as objects.
4.  **Post-Processing:**
    * **Sorting:** Detections are sorted Left-to-Right via X-coordinates.
    * **Filtering:** Detections in the top 35% of the plate (logos/Arabic script) are discarded.
    * **Mapping:** English characters are converted to the Saudi Arabic format.
